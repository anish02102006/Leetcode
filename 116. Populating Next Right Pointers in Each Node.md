# Intuition
We are given a perfect binary tree where every internal node has two children.
The key observation is that nodes at the same level can be connected using their parents' next pointers.

For each parent, link its left.next → right.
If the parent has a next, link right.next → parent.next.left.
This way, we can connect all nodes level by level without extra space.

# Approach
Start from the leftmost node at each level.

Use a pointer curr to traverse across that level using already established next links.

Connect:

curr.left.next = curr.right
If curr.next != null, then curr.right.next = curr.next.left
After finishing one level, move to the next level using leftMost = leftMost.left.

Continue until all levels are processed.

# Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) — each node is visited once.
Space Complexity: O(1) — only pointers are used (constant extra space).

# Code
class Solution {

    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return root;

        Node leftMost = root;

        // Traverse level by level
        while (leftMost.left != null) {
            Node curr = leftMost;
            while (curr != null) {
                // Connect left -> right
                curr.left.next = curr.right;

                // Connect right -> next's left (if available)
                if (curr.next != null) {
                    curr.right.next = curr.next.left;
                }

                curr = curr.next; // Move to next node in the level
            }
            leftMost = leftMost.left; // Go to next level
        }
        return root;
    }
}
