# Intuition
We need to monitor a stream of numbers and check if a certain value appears consecutively at least k times. Counting consecutive occurrences as the stream arrives is straightforward.

# Approach
Keep track of the current consecutive count of the target value.

On receiving a new number:

If it matches the target, increment count.

Otherwise, reset count to zero.

Return true if count is at least k.

# Complexity
Time complexity:
O(1) per query, since we only update and check a counter.

Space complexity:
O(1), only a few variables stored.

# Code

class DataStream {


    private final int value;
    private final int k;
    private int count;

    public DataStream(int value, int k) {
        this.value = value;
        this.k = k;
        this.count = 0;
    }

    public boolean consec(int num) {
        if (num == value) count++;
        else count = 0;
        return count >= k;
    }
}
