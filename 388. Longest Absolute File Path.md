Intuition
The function computes the length of the longest absolute path to a file within a simulated file system formatted as a string, where directories and files are demarcated by tabs and newlines.


Approach
Initialize Variables: Set up a dictionary pathMap to track cumulative path lengths at different depths, starting with the root.
Split and Process Each Line: Split the input on newlines and iterate through each, calculating depth based on tabs and determining if the line represents a file or directory.
Update Path Lengths: For files, update the maximum path length if the current file's path is longer. For directories, update pathMap with the cumulative path length for the next depth.
Return the Result: After processing all lines, return the longest path length found to any file.

class Solution {

    public int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
        int longest = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> pathMap = new HashMap<>();
        pathMap.put(0, 0);

        String[] lines = input.split("\n");

        for (String line : lines) {
            String name = line.replaceAll("\t", "");
            int depth = line.length() - name.length();

            if (name.contains(".")) {
                // It's a file
                longest = Math.max(longest, pathMap.get(depth) + name.length());
            } else {
                // It's a directory
                pathMap.put(depth + 1, pathMap.get(depth) + name.length() + 1);
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
}
