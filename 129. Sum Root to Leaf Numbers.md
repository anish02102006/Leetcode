Intuition
Every root-to-leaf path in the tree forms a number by concatenating the node values. For example, the path 1 → 2 → 3 becomes 123.

We want to traverse all root-to-leaf paths and compute the number formed by each path, then return their sum.

🛠️ Approach
We use DFS to traverse the tree.
At each step, we build the path by multiplying the previous path by 10 and adding the current node's value.
If we reach a leaf node, we add the path value to a global sum.
Recursively do this for left and right subtrees.
🧮 Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) – visit each node once
Space Complexity: O(h) – recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree

code:
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;

    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root, 0);
        return sum;
    }

    void helper(TreeNode node, int path) {
        if (node == null) return;
        path = path * 10 + node.val;
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            sum += path;
        }
        helper(node.left, path);
        helper(node.right, path);
    }
}
