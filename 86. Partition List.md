# Problem Understanding
In the "Partition a Linked List Around a Value" problem, we are provided with the head of a linked list and a value x. The task is to rearrange the linked list such that all nodes with values less than x come before nodes with values greater than or equal to x. A key point is that the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions must be preserved.

Consider the linked list head = [1,4,3,2,5,2] and x = 3. The expected output after partitioning is [1,2,2,4,3,5].

# Approach: Two Pointer Technique with Dummy Nodes
The idea is to use two pointers (or references) to create two separate linked lists:

One for nodes with values less than x
Another for nodes with values greater than or equal to x
At the end, we can combine the two linked lists to get the desired result.

Key Data Structures:
Linked List: We work directly with the given linked list nodes.
Dummy Nodes: Two dummy nodes are used to create the starting point for the two partitions.
Step-by-step Breakdown:
Initialization:

Create two dummy nodes: before and after.
Initialize two pointers before_curr and after_curr at the dummy nodes.
Traversal & Partition:

Traverse the linked list with the given head.
For each node, if its value is less than x, attach it to the before list. Otherwise, attach it to the after list.
Merging:

After traversing the entire list, append the after list to the before list to form the partitioned linked list.
Result:

Return the next node of the before dummy node as the new head of the partitioned list.
Example - Visualization:
Based on the provided example with the linked list head = [1,4,3,2,5,2] and x = 3, here's the step-by-step evolution of the before, after, and head lists:

After processing node with value 1:

head: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2]
before: [0, 1]
after: [0]
After processing node with value 4:

head: [4, 3, 2, 5, 2]
before: [0, 1]
after: [0, 4]
After processing node with value 3:

head: [3, 2, 5, 2]
before: [0, 1]
after: [0, 4, 3]
After processing node with value 2:

head: [2, 5, 2]
before: [0, 1, 2]
after: [0, 4, 3]
After processing node with value 5:

head: [5, 2]
before: [0, 1, 2]
after: [0, 4, 3, 5]
After processing node with value 2:

head: [2]
before: [0, 1, 2, 2]
after: [0, 4, 3, 5]
Finally, after merging the before and after lists, the result is: [1,2,2,4,3,5]

# Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)

We traverse the linked list once, making the time complexity linear in the size of the list.
Space Complexity: O(1)

We use constant extra space since we are only creating two dummy nodes and reusing the existing nodes in the linked list.
Performance:
Given the constraints, this solution is optimal and will efficiently handle linked lists of size up to 200 nodes.
