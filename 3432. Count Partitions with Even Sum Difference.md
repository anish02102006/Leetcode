Approach: Mathematics
Intuition
Let the sum of the elements in the array nums be sum, and let the sums of the two non-empty subarrays be x and y, respectively. Clearly, x+y=sum.

If sum is odd, then either x is odd and y is even, or x is even and y is odd, so x−y is odd.

If sum is even, then either both x and y are odd or both are even, so x−y is even.

From this, let n be the number of elements in nums. When sum is even, the number of partitioning schemes with an even difference is n−1. When sum is odd, the number of such schemes is 0.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of nums.

Time complexity: O(n).

Space complexity: O(1).
