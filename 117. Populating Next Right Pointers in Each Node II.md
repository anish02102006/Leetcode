# Intuition
We need to connect each node's next pointer to its right neighbor at the same level.
A level-order (BFS) traversal using a queue makes it easy to track nodes level-by-level and link their next pointers accordingly.

# Approach
Use a queue for BFS traversal.
For each level:
Process all nodes.
For every node except the last, set curr.next = q.peek() (next node in the same level).
Add left and right children to the queue for the next level.
# Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) (for queue)

# Code
class Solution {

    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return root;

        Queue<Node> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int level = q.size();
            while (level-- > 0) {
                Node curr = q.poll();
                if (level != 0) curr.next = q.peek();
                if (curr.left != null) q.add(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) q.add(curr.right);
            }
        }

        return root;
    }
}
